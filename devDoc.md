Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide for a programmer to implement the solution where each 4MB chunk is processed in a new worker, and the worker is terminated after completing the task:

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1. Modify the Main Script (`main.js`) to Handle Worker Creation**

1. **Update the main script (`main.js`) to handle 4MB chunk processing in workers:**
   - Define a method `processFile()` that reads the file and processes it in chunks.
   - For each chunk, a new web worker should be created and terminated after processing.
   
2. **Refactor the `processFile()` Function:**
   - Update the file reading logic to slice the file into 4MB chunks.
   - After slicing each chunk, create a new worker for each chunk.
   - Send the chunk to the worker via `postMessage`.
   - Listen for the response from the worker when the chunk is processed.
   - After receiving the response, terminate the worker and proceed to the next chunk.

3. **Code Changes:**
   - Define the worker message handling logic within the `processChunk()` function.
   - Refactor the small chunk sending logic (`processSmallChunks`) to ensure chunks are processed asynchronously in workers.

4. **Add Chunk Processing Logic:**
   - Create a `processSmallChunks()` function to break down the 4MB chunk into smaller 500KB packets.
   - Send each packet to the main thread and trigger events for the user interface or server to handle the data.
   
#### **2. Create the Web Worker Script (`chunkWorker.js`)**

1. **Create the Worker File:**
   - Create a new file named `chunkWorker.js`. This file will contain the logic for handling each 4MB chunk, calculating its SHA256 hash, and converting it to base64 format.

2. **Inside `chunkWorker.js`:**
   - Import the necessary utility functions (`calculateSHA256`, `arrayBufferToBase64`).
   - Write the logic to calculate the SHA256 hash for the chunk.
   - After calculating the hash, convert the chunk to a base64 string and send both the hash and the base64 string back to the main thread using `postMessage()`.

#### **3. Update the Utility Functions**

1. **Refactor Utility Functions (Optional):**
   - Ensure utility functions like `calculateSHA256`, `arrayBufferToBase64`, and `calculateBase64SHA256` are working correctly and can be reused both in the main thread and worker thread.
   - If needed, convert them to modules that can be imported in both scripts (`main.js` and `chunkWorker.js`).

#### **4. Implement Message Passing between Main Script and Worker**

1. **Main Script Message Handling:**
   - In the main script, set up `onmessage` handlers for each worker. When the worker completes processing, it should send back the processed data (SHA256 and base64-encoded chunk).
   - Ensure that when a worker sends back the result, the main script will:
     - Mark the current chunk as processed.
     - Send the small 500KB chunks to the server or the next step.
     - Terminate the worker and proceed to the next chunk.

2. **Worker Script Message Handling:**
   - In the worker script, set up the `onmessage` event to receive the 4MB chunk from the main thread.
   - Perform the necessary processing (SHA256 and base64 encoding).
   - Once processing is done, use `postMessage` to send the result back to the main thread.

#### **5. Test the Workflow with a Sample File**

1. **Test File Upload and Chunk Processing:**
   - Upload a sample file and check if the file is sliced into 4MB chunks.
   - Ensure each chunk is processed in a new worker and the worker terminates after processing.

2. **Check Worker Termination:**
   - Use browser dev tools to confirm that the worker is created and terminated for each chunk.

#### **6. Optimize and Handle Edge Cases**

1. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle errors in both the main script and the worker. Ensure proper error messages are sent to the main thread if a chunk fails to process.
   
2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Avoid creating too many workers at once. You can limit the number of active workers to avoid overwhelming the system (e.g., only process 2-3 chunks at a time).
   
3. **Progress Updates:**
   - Send progress updates to the UI as each chunk is processed.

### **Detailed Task Breakdown**

| **Task** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 1. **Create `main.js` logic** | - Slice the file into 4MB chunks. <br> - Create a new worker for each chunk. <br> - Send the chunk to the worker. |
| 2. **Create `chunkWorker.js`** | - Calculate SHA256 of the chunk. <br> - Convert chunk to base64. <br> - Return the result to the main thread. |
| 3. **Implement message passing** | - Handle message passing between the main script and worker. <br> - Ensure that the worker sends back the processed chunk and hash, then terminates. |
| 4. **Test with a sample file** | - Upload a test file. <br> - Check if each chunk is processed in a worker. <br> - Confirm that each worker is terminated after processing. |
| 5. **Handle error cases** | - Add error handling for file reading, worker creation, and processing errors. |
| 6. **Optimize performance** | - Implement a mechanism to limit the number of active workers (e.g., process 2-3 chunks concurrently). |

By following these steps, you can efficiently implement the solution where each 4MB chunk is processed in a separate worker and terminated after processing, providing a scalable and efficient way to handle large files.
